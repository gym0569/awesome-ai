1. age: continuous
2. sex: categorical, 2 values {0: female, 1: male}
3. cp (chest pain type): categorical, 4 values
    {1: typical angina, 2: atypical angina, 3: non-angina, 4: asymptomatic angina}
4. restbp (resting blood pressure on admission to hospital): continuous (mmHg)
5. chol (serum cholesterol level): continuous (mg/dl)
6. fbs (fasting blood sugar): categorical, 2 values {0: <= 120 mg/dl, 1: > 120 mg/dl}
7. restecg (resting electrocardiography): categorical, 3 values
    {0: normal, 1: ST-T wave abnormality, 2: left ventricular hypertrophy}
8. thalach (maximum heart rate achieved): continuous
9. exang (exercise induced angina): categorical, 2 values {0: no, 1: yes}
10. oldpeak (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest): continuous
11. slope (slope of peak exercise ST segment): categorical, 3 values 
    {1: upsloping, 2: flat, 3: downsloping}
12. ca (number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy): discrete (0,1,2,3)
13. thal: categorical, 3 values {3: normal, 6: fixed defect, 7: reversible defect}
14. num (diagnosis of heart disease): categorical, 5 values 
    {0: less than 50% narrowing in any major vessel, 1-4: more than 50% narrowing in 1-4 vessels}

The actual number of feature variables (after converting categorical variables
to dummy ones) is: 
1 (age) + 1 (sex) + 3 (cp) + 1 (restbp) + 1 (chol) + 1 (fbs) + 2 (restecg) + 
1 (thalach) + 1 (exang) + 1 (oldpeak) + 2 (slope) + 1 (ca) + 2 (thal) = 18
