## <b>Artificial Intelligence - Machine Learning - Deep LeanringData Sciences </b>

The main aim of the repo is to provide you with the first hand knowledge and understanding of <b> machine learning (including deep learning </b> through multiple examples. The way things are implemented in the examples are not the only or the best way. Explore your options and adapt to the one which suits you the best. I have used Python 3 as my primary language for implementing most of the models.

This repo also contains many solutions to the problems from **Kaggle** competitions.

<b> The more you do, the more you learn. </b>
